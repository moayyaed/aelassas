I am a software architect with 10+ years experience working with Node.js, Next.js, React, React Native, MongoDB, .NET and C#. I am a graduate engineer in software computing ([ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_d%27%C3%A9lectronique,_informatique,_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9communications,_math%C3%A9matique_et_m%C3%A9canique_de_Bordeaux), France, 2010).

I started as .NET developer intern in a marketing company in Bordeaux, France where I worked on e-marketing platforms for some time. Afterwards, I moved to Paris where I worked for some years as a software engineer on Video On Demand and Digital Asset Management systems in a telecommunication company. Then, I went back to my home city Casablanca, Morocco where I work now as a software architect mainly with Node.js, React, React Native, MongoDB, .NET and C#. As a software architect, my work force relies on the creation and development of innovative solutions and to be able to adapt them to the different sectors which seek to simplify or automate their work processes or data management.

I still hope one day to start by own business.
