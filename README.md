I am a software architect with 10+ years experience working with Node.js, Next.js, React, React Native, MongoDB, .NET and C#. I am a graduate engineer in software computing ([ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_d%27%C3%A9lectronique,_informatique,_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9communications,_math%C3%A9matique_et_m%C3%A9canique_de_Bordeaux), France, 2010).

I started as .NET developer intern in a marketing company in Bordeaux, France where I worked on e-marketing platforms for some time. Afterwards, I moved to Paris where I worked for some years as a software engineer in a telecommunication company where I worked on Video On Demand and Digital Asset Management systems. Then, I went back to my home city Casablanca, Morocco where I work now as a software architect mainly with Node.js, React, React Native, MongoDB, .NET and C#. I am passionate about web and mobile development.

I still hope one day to start by own business.
